# CUDA Optimization

This component provides benchmarks and optimization techniques for NVIDIA RTX A5500 GPU.

## Objective
Measure and optimize GPU computing performance through targeted optimizations.

## System Specifications
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX A5500
- **CUDA Capability**: 8.6
- **Memory**: 23.52 GB GDDR6
- **Memory Bus Width**: 384 bits
- **Memory Clock**: 8.00 GHz
- **CUDA Cores**: 10240
- **Core Clock**: 1.67 GHz

## Benchmarks

### Memory Bandwidth
Measures the effective memory transfer speed between global memory and GPU cores.

**Implementation**: `benchmarks/memory_bandwidth.cu`  
**Results**:
- **Measured Bandwidth**: 666.39 GB/s
- **Theoretical Bandwidth**: 768.10 GB/s
- **Efficiency**: 86.76%
- **Execution Time**: 80.56 ms

This benchmark performs simple load/store operations on a large array to measure sustainable memory throughput. The high efficiency (86.76%) indicates excellent memory subsystem performance.

### Compute Throughput
Measures floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) for FP32 operations.

**Implementation**: `benchmarks/compute_throughput.cu`  
**Results**:
- **Measured Throughput**: 19.11 TFLOPS
- **Theoretical Peak**: 34.10 TFLOPS
- **Efficiency**: 56.03%
- **Execution Time**: 0.35 ms

This benchmark uses fused multiply-add (FMA) operations to measure computational throughput. The 56% efficiency is typical for compute-bound workloads due to instruction pipeline limitations.

## How to Run
